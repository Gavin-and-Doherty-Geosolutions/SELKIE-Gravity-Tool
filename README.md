# SELKIE-Gravity-Tool
This tool was designed to provide a preliminary sizing and costing for gravity-based fixed & anchors offshore foundations. The input parameters are user-defined. The module uses assumptions and formulae from different guidelines, primarily the handbook for marine geotechnical engineering. The user can define the location data, device data, and some design parameters: whether the foundation is embedded or not, and whether a perimeter skirt is provided or not.
Design checks are performed for sliding, bearing (drained and undrained), and overturning resistance in both x and y directions. The outputs is a CSV file including a design space of foundation sizes and design checks as well as the minimum viable foundation size, a preliminary CAPEX estimate based on the unit cost specified for the foundation material.
